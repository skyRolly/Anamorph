# DOCUMENTATION_COVERAGE.md

Permanent documentation-coverage audit. **Future contributors/AI must update this on every
documentation-affecting change** (`docs/policies/DOCUMENTATION_LIFECYCLE_POLICY.md`).

Coverage = how well the module/topic is documented. Confidence = strength of the evidence behind
that documentation (Verified / Partially Verified / Unverified / Not Supported).

Last updated: for Wave-2 Step-1 (PR #58) — no module-coverage change; the H11/ALG-4 DSP work is
documented in DSP_ALGORITHMS + PERFORMANCE_BUDGET + CHANGELOG, and `AI_AGENT_POLICY.md` gained
constraint C8 (UI text requires explicit instruction). Retro-covers PR #57 (KNOWN_ISSUES KI-008
added; no coverage change — this header was missed in that PR). Prior: the 0.8.9 release (PR #56)
— no coverage change; the 0.8.8 idle-performance PR (#54) — threading paths (`soundParamGen`) and
the ScopeBuffer per-block publication model documented; prior full audit at HEAD `c605fbe`
(JUCE 8.0.14).

## Code-module coverage

| Module | Documented in | Coverage | Confidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| `AnamorphEngine` (chain/switch machine) | SIGNAL_FLOW, DSP_GRAPH_REFERENCE, DSP_ALGORITHMS, ADR-0004/0005/0006 | Full | Verified |
| `EngineParameters` (POD boundary) | ARCHITECTURE, API_REFERENCE, ADR-0001 | Full | Verified |
| `PluginParameters` / APVTS | PARAMETER_REGISTRY, PARAMETER_REFERENCE, ADR-0002 | Full | Verified |
| `InternalState` | PARAMETER_REGISTRY, STATE_SERIALIZATION, ADR-0010 | Full | Verified |
| `PresetManager` | API_REFERENCE, STATE_SERIALIZATION | Partial (interface + role; preset file format not exhaustively documented) | Verified |
| State save/recall | STATE_SERIALIZATION, SERIALIZATION_REGISTRY | Full | Verified |
| `MidSide` | DSP_ALGORITHMS | Full | Verified |
| `HaasProcessor` | DSP_ALGORITHMS | Full | Verified |
| `VelvetNoise` | DSP_ALGORITHMS | Full | Verified |
| `ChorusEngine` | DSP_ALGORITHMS | Full | Verified |
| `MonoMaker` | DSP_ALGORITHMS, SIGNAL_FLOW, ADR-0006 | Full | Verified |
| `MultibandWidth` | DSP_ALGORITHMS, ADR-0005/0009 | Full | Verified |
| `SoloMonitor` | DSP_ALGORITHMS, ADR-0004/0006 | Full | Verified |
| `LoudnessMatch` | DSP_ALGORITHMS, ADR-0007 | Full | Verified |
| `Correlation` / `LevelMeters` / `ScopeBuffer` | DSP_ALGORITHMS, THREAD_MODEL | Full | Verified |
| Threading / OpenGL gate | THREAD_MODEL, ADR-0011 | Full | Verified |
| Latency / PDC | LATENCY_MODEL, ADR-0003 | Full | Verified |
| Real-time safety | REALTIME_SAFETY_AUDIT, REALTIME_AUDIO_POLICY | Full | Verified |
| `PluginEditor` / `gui/*` | THREAD_MODEL, REPOSITORY_MAP | Partial (threading + lifecycle documented; per-widget layout/LookAndFeel not exhaustively) | Verified |
| Build / CI / packaging | BUILD, CI_CD, PACKAGING | Full | Verified |
| Tests | TESTING, TESTING_POLICY | Full | Verified |
| Performance (numbers) | PERFORMANCE_BUDGET | Structural only | Unverified (no benchmark data — TODOs) |
| Host (DAW) compatibility | COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX | Listed | Unverified (no in-repo DAW tests) |
| AAX, mono→mono | COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX, COMPATIBILITY_POLICY | Documented as excluded | Not Supported |

## Documentation-set self-coverage (deliverables present)

| Tier | Files | Status |
|---|---|---|
| docs root | SOURCE_OF_TRUTH, HANDOVER, REPOSITORY_MAP, DOCUMENTATION_COVERAGE, POSTMORTEMS, KNOWN_ISSUES, FUTURE_RISKS | Present |
| architecture | 14 docs + ADR_INDEX + 12 ADRs | Present |
| procedures | 8 docs | Present |
| policies | 15 docs | Present |
| root | README, CHANGELOG, CLAUDE | Present |

## Known coverage gaps / TODOs

- **Performance numbers** — `PERFORMANCE_BUDGET.md` carries explicit TODOs; populate from profiling.
- **DAW host matrix** — `COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX.md` hosts are Unverified; populate from manual testing.
- **GUI per-widget reference** — editor layout/LookAndFeel is documented at the threading/lifecycle
  level only; a per-widget reference is not present (low priority — GUI changes don't gate releases).
- **Pre-0.6 version history** — CHANGELOG entries for early versions are Partially Verified (README
  + commits); no git tags exist for exact per-version attribution.

## Update protocol

On any change, set this file's "Last updated" to the new HEAD and adjust the affected rows. A new
module → add a row; a new doc → add to self-coverage; new perf/host data → upgrade the confidence.
